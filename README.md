# nand2tetris
This project is aimed at the, "construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up."

As per the description, this project is broken up into two sections. First section is hardware, where I will build the computer. The second section is software, where I will build the software for the computer to run on.

By the end, I would have completed 12 projects:

## Hardware
- [x] [Boolean Logic](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01)
- [x] [Boolean Arithmetic](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project02)
